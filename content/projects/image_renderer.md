## About 
Image Renderer is a simple python tool that converts raw rgb data into a visible jpeg image. 
I originally made this script for a school project where we got raw data from a camera(the OV7670) and had to interpret
this data. There was no way to do this, so I wrote a quick script. This is how Image Renderer was born. Later, I made
some small improvements and added some more command line options of this tool.
