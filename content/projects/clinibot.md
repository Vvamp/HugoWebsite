## About 
Clinibot was a school project where we, in a team of 4, had to create a robot with lego and a brick pi. 
This robot needed to have a medical purpose. Our idea was a robot that was able to bring and returns items to and from
patients, following a simple grid. 

The robot follows a given path and waits at the destination until the weight from its arm is lifted. 
When something is put back, the robot returnes to where it came from.
