My name is Vincent. I'm a Dutch computer sciences student with a passion for Linux and close-to-the-hardware
programming. 

I've been programming for the better part of my life and I am absolutely addicted to it. It has also brought me
into contact with linux and FOSS. This has inspired me to teach others about Linux and programming. My belief is that
everyone should have an operating system that they, themselves, own. People should also have the choice over what
software they want to use, no matter the operating system they are using; full, limitless customizability.
